# chess_game
Uncompleted chess game. It works OK but it has some flaws, not every rules are set and the opponent can't make a move, i think this project is really
close to being completed but, I made some mistakes with game planning so it is hard to for example let the opponent move. 

Rules are simple you can move white pieces using scroll_up or scroll_down and kill opponent pieces that are highlighted with red color.
